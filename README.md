Project Title: House Rent Prediction using Machine Learning

You built a machine learning model to predict house rents based on various factors like location, size, and amenities.
Problem Statement

The project aimed to create a tool that helps homeowners and renters estimate the rent of a house, making the renting process more transparent and efficient.
Data Collection

You used a dataset that included multiple features relevant to house rents, such as the house’s location, size, number of rooms, and available amenities.
Data Cleaning

You cleaned the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was accurate and reliable.
Feature Engineering

You created new features or transformed existing ones to improve the model’s ability to make accurate predictions. This might have involved normalizing data or creating interaction terms.
Model Selection

You tried different machine learning models, like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, to find the best fit for predicting house rents.
Model Training

You trained the models on a portion of the dataset, allowing the models to learn the relationships between the features and the rent prices.
Model Evaluation

You evaluated the models’ performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure they were accurate in their predictions.
Challenges and Solutions

You faced challenges such as overfitting or dealing with noisy data. You overcame these by techniques like cross-validation and feature selection.
Conclusion and Impact

The project resulted in a model that can predict house rents with reasonable accuracy, potentially helping users make better-informed decisions in the housing market.
